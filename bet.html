        <h1>BET TYPES</h1>
        <p> The four different bet types we use are : Algorithmic, Council, Community, and Unified.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Algorithmic Bet</h2>
        <p> The  Algorithmic Bet is a data-driven bet type powered by advanced algorithms and AI technology. This bet type leverages machine learning models and statistical analysis to predict the most favorable outcomes across various sports events. The AI analyzes historical data, player statistics, weather conditions, and other factors to identify bets with the highest probability of success. The Algorithmic Bet represents a cutting-edge, tech-focused approach to sports betting, offering a high level of precision and efficiency.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Council Bet</h2>
        <p> The Council Bet is curated by the Lock Council, a group of expert sports bettors and analysts. These seasoned professionals specialize in different sports and bring their deep understanding of the game, team dynamics, and market movements to the table. The Lock Council carefully assesses potential bets each week, using their expertise to propose and lock in the best possible bets. The Council Bet leverages human insight and experience over algorithms, relying on the collective knowledge of industry experts.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Community Bet</h2>
        <p> The Community Bet is driven by the collective wisdom and preferences of the LockProfit community. Community members actively participate by voting on potential bets, sharing insights, and discussing strategies. This bet type reflects the choices of our diverse community, combining different perspectives and opinions. It's a great way for members to directly get involved in the betting process and contribute to the decision-making. The Community Bet is about fostering engagement and leveraging the power of a diverse, decentralized group of bettors.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Unified Bet</h2>
        <p> The Unified Bet combines the best of all worldsâ€”the analytical power of the Algorithmic Bet, the expertise of the Council Bet, and the collective wisdom of the Community Bet. This bet type integrates insights from the AI, the Lock Council, and community votes to create a balanced and well-rounded betting strategy. The Unified Bet is placed every weekend, offering a unique opportunity to capitalize on a blend of data-driven analysis, professional insight, and community input. It's a comprehensive bet that maximizes the strengths of all stakeholders involved in the LockProfit ecosystem. </p>
        <br>
        <p> By utilizing these four distinct bet types, LockProfit ensures a dynamic and inclusive betting experience, catering to different preferences and betting strategies. Whether you trust algorithms, human expertise, community consensus, or a mix of all three, there's a bet type for everyone! </p>
